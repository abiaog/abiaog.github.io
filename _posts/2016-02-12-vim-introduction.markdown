# How to view code in vim?
	ctags
	cscope
	cflow
	calltree

	zt			Like "z<CR>", but leave the cursor in the same
				column.  {not in Vi}
	zz			Like "z.", but leave the cursor in the same column.
				Careful: If caps-lock is on, this command becomes
				"ZZ": write buffer and exit!  {not in Vi}
	zb			Like "z-", but leave the cursor in the same column.
				{not in Vi}
